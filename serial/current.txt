in order to calculate the acceleration we must use newtons second law of motion
acceleration = force/mass


BUT in order to calculate the force for this we must do this other equation
force of i to j = Gravity * ((mass of i * mass of j) / (r*r) )

velocity = initial velocity + acceleration * time since this velocity(our delta time)
