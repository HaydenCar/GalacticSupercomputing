Using High Performance Computing we will be undertaking a project where we will calculate an N-body Simulation. This will involve the use of Multi-Threading and a Visualisation Software.

To build and run the code, download the folder cd into the serial subfolder and use the make command to build and then you will be able to run the exe.

This is a year 3 computing group project.
Group Members: Hayden Carr, Ramazan Iskandarov, Isabella Sturzu.
